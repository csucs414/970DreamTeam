Sprint #2

Goal: Playable Game (game logic)

Sprint Leader: Mike Popesh

Definition of Done

User can create a gameboard populated with pieces and manipulate those pieces according to the rules of the game.

Policies:

Clean Code


Test Driven Development

    Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
    Unit tests are fully automated.
   
Configuration Management

    Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
    All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
    All commits include a task/issue number.
    All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
    All tests pass.

Continuous Integration / Delivery

    Master is never broken. If broken, it is fixed immediately.
    Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
    All Java dependencies in pom.xml. Do not load external libraries in your repo.
