## Sprint 3

**Goal:** Two players login/create accounts and play game online.

**Sprint Leader:** Mike Popesh

**Definition of Done**

Players are able to register a new account, login to an existing account, see other online players, and invite other players to a game.

#### Policies:

**Clean Code**


**Test Driven Development**

    Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
    Unit tests are fully automated.
   
**Configuration Management**

    Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
    All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
    All commits include a task/issue number.
    All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
    All tests pass.

**Continuous Integration / Delivery**

    Master is never broken. If broken, it is fixed immediately.
    Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
    All Java dependencies in pom.xml. Do not load external libraries in your repo.

#### Plan

**This sprint will complete the following Epics.**

    #1, #2, #4, #5, #8, #9, #11, #12

#### Retrospective

**These Epics were completed:**
11, 8, 1, 2, 4, 12, 5

**Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog:**
7, 10

**These Epics were not completed:**
7, 10

**What went well:**
Communication was a strongpoint, less meetings more coding, hit our stride at the end. We were also able to detect and solve bugs faster as a team. When someone needed help, others were more than willing to jump in and help them. Tasks and epics were tackled as more of a collective effort compared to just breaking off and doing things on our own. Overall, we grew well as a team

**What we changed this sprint:**
Less meetings due to increased comfort with the class and eachother. We made sure to share understandings of new code with eachother and also implemented new coding techniques such as incremental development.  
    
**What we did well:**
Debugging, working together as a team, researching to understand and implement new code and topics.

**What we need to work on:**
Need to leave a little bit more time to refacotr our code at the end and test by exhaustion a little bit more. 

**What we will change next sprint:**
N/A last sprint of the semester
