# Rules

## Setup:
* Two players. Attackers (black pieces) and Defenders (white pieces).
* 11x11 board. Twice as many attackers as defenders.
* Attacker moves first.
* Defenders have King piece.

## Objectives:
* Attackers: Capture the King.
* Defenders: King escapes.
* King is captured by getting surrounded by Attack on 4 sides or 3 sides and a restricted space.
* The Kind escapes by reaching 1 of the 4 corner squares. 
* Regular pieces captured by getting surrounded on opposite sides by 2 pieces or 1 and a restricted space. (sandwiched)
* The King can participate in the capture if its is the moving piece.
* A player may only capture an enemy piece if they surround it with a move on their turn.

## Moving:
* Each piece (including King) can move vertical or horizontal. Similar to a Rook in chess.
* 1 piece may move per turn.
* Only king may stop on the Throne (center square).
* A piece can only move through empty spaces.
* A piece may pass inbetween enemy pieces and not get captured.
* The throne and 4 corners are considered restricted spaces.
* The throne is always hostile to attackers and can be used to capture their pieces.
* The throne is only hostile to defenders if it is vacated by the King.
* The corners are hostile to both players.
